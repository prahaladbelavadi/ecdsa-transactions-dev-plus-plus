#### What is a finite field:
- It is a set of numbers
- Finite set
- Four operations in Finite fields ( addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
  - Considered closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division except division by 0)
  - These are operations we are going to define
  - Exception: Division by zero;
  - Define division in such a way that it belongs in the finite field
  - Closed means that if you take two elements perform an operation among them, they belong in the same finite field.
- Used at a variety of places but mainly for elliptic curve cryptography
- Prime fields are most interesting

#### Example
Prime Field of 19 (Denoted as F~19~)
- F~19~ = {0, 1, 2, ... , 18}
- F~97~ = {0, 1, 2, ... , 96}
- F~48947~ = {0, 1, 2, ... , 48946}
